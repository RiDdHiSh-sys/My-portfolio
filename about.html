            <p>Hi, I'm Riddhish, a first-year B.Tech CSE (AI) student at KIET Group of Institutions.I am currently also a member technical club called CPBYTE.
I'm passionate about technology, AI, and building things that solve real problems. Being early in my engineering journey, I love exploring new tools, ideas, and projects that help me grow both technically and creatively.</p>
            <p>I'm curious by nature — whether it's understanding how systems work, experimenting with new concepts, or diving into discussions around technology, markets, geopolitics, and how they shape the world. I enjoy challenging assumptions, learning deeply, and improving a little every day.</p>
            <p>My goal is to evolve into a strong problem-solver and engineer, build impactful projects, and constantly push myself to think smarter and work smarter.</p>
